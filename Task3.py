# Project Name: Expense Tracker
# Project Overview:
# This project aims to develop an expense tracking system to help users manage their daily expenses efficiently.
# It includes functionalities for user input, data management, expense categorization, data analysis, user interface, error handling, and documentation.

# Import necessary modules
import pandas as pd

# Define a class for the Expense Tracker
class ExpenseTracker:
    def __init__(self):
        self.expense_data = pd.DataFrame(columns=['Date', 'Amount', 'Category'])
    
    # Method to allow users to input their daily expenses
    def input_expense(self, date, amount, category):
        self.expense_data = self.expense_data.append({'Date': date, 'Amount': amount, 'Category': category}, ignore_index=True)
    
    # Method to store and manage the entered expense data
    def manage_data(self):
        # Implement data storage mechanism (e.g., save data to a CSV file)
        self.expense_data.to_csv('expense_data.csv', index=False)
    
    # Method to categorize expenses into different categories
    def categorize_expenses(self):
        # Implement logic to categorize expenses based on user-defined categories
        pass
    
    # Method to provide users with insights into their spending patterns
    def analyze_data(self):
        # Implement data analysis functionalities (e.g., monthly summaries, category-wise expenditure)
        pass
    
    # Method to create a user-friendly interface
    def create_interface(self):
        # Implement a graphical or command-line interface for user interaction
        pass
    
    # Method to implement error handling
    def handle_errors(self):
        # Implement error handling mechanisms to gracefully handle unexpected inputs
        pass
    
    # Method to document the code effectively
    def document_code(self):
        # Document the code using comments, docstrings, and/or README files to ensure clarity and understanding
        pass

# Instantiate the ExpenseTracker class
expense_tracker = ExpenseTracker()

# Example usage:
# expense_tracker.input_expense('2024-02-20', 50.00, 'Groceries')
# expense_tracker.manage_data()
# expense_tracker.categorize_expenses()
# expense_tracker.analyze_data()
# expense_tracker.create_interface()
# expense_tracker.handle_errors()
# expense_tracker.document_code()
